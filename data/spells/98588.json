  "Description_lang": "Voodoo figurines such as this were built and animated to assist troll witch doctors in minor, everyday tasks such as washing loincloths or scrubbing blood off the hut floor. They were often powered by flasks of mojo, troll sweat, the flesh of tribal enemies, or by DEVOURING TINY PORTIONS OF THEIR OWNERS' SOULS. But don't worry. Teeny, tiny little portions. You won't even notice they're gone. And think how clean your floors will be!",
