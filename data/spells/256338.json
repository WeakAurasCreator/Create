  "Description_lang": "Eonar creates the Gift of the Lifebinder, a life-giving tree that springs forth to save the players. The Gift of the Lifebinder is created with several stacks of Life-Giving Roots, depending on players' raid size. Players may heal the Gift of the Lifebinder.While the Gift of the Lifebinder lives, players may freely Release Spirit after dying while fighting Argus and will return to the encounter space as ghosts. If players move to the tree as ghosts, they will be returned to life. However, returning to life in this way will remove a stack of Life-giving Roots. Once the Life-giving Roots are consumed, resurrecting using the Gift of the Lifebinder will cause it to suffer from Withered Roots.",
