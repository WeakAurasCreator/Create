  "Description_lang": "During times of war, the Zandalari faced off against many powerful foes. Some, even, that they could not break. Their witchdoctors devised these cursed pots and through the use of powerful magic, summoned them at different locations within the enemy's encampment. Shortly after, a fountain of frogs would spring forth, causing a ruckus and confusing the enemy in the process. Little did they know that these frogs carried a plague with them that would quickly devastate their ranks and force them to retreat or surrender.",
