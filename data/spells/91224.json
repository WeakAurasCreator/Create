  "Description_lang": "The Word and the Oath of Empress Zoe were once a pair of powerful magical rings. The ring you have recovered was the Word, which sadly was stripped of its magical properties when it was shattered. The Oath has been lost but may yet endure. The empress herself was a little known Dark Iron ruler. Many dwarves lost their lives humoring her obsession with dragons by attempting to steal their eggs or young.",
