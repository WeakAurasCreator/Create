  "Description_lang": "$@spelldesc435821Herbs on Khaz Algar have taken on many different variations to adapt to their environment, but one evolution stands out as particularly fascinating.These herbs are camouflaged; completely invisible to the unassisted eye! Aspiring herbalists and alchemists have found ways to see them, but the fact that they managed to go undetected for so long is nothing short of astounding.While they have no extra usable materials to speak of, the herbs themselves are just as useful as their less roguish counterparts.",
